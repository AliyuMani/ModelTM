# ModelTM
This repository contains python implementation of an optimization model with experimental data for rescheduling trains
at railway passenger stations in the event of infrastructure maintenance disruption in real-time. 
the MILP model is solved using the decision optimization package, Docplex. DOCPLEX is a Python package from
IBM ILOG CPLEX for integer linear programming and constraint programming. As such, one needs to install the package before they can run 
the python parsers in this repository to solve the model.
